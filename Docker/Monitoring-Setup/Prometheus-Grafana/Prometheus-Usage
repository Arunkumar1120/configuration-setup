ðŸ”¹ Prometheus Usage

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system, widely used for metrics collection in cloud-native environments (especially Kubernetes, Docker, microservices).

Key Uses:

Metrics Collection

Scrapes metrics from applications, exporters, and system endpoints (/metrics).

Works with pull-based model (Prometheus pulls data at intervals).

Stores metrics in a time-series database.

Exporters

Prometheus uses exporters to collect metrics from different systems:

Node Exporter â†’ Linux system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network).

cAdvisor â†’ Container metrics.

Blackbox Exporter â†’ HTTP, TCP, DNS, ICMP probes.

Kafka / MySQL / Redis exporters â†’ Application-specific metrics.

Alerting

With Alertmanager, you can set alert rules (e.g., CPU > 90%, service down).

Sends alerts to Slack, Email, PagerDuty, Webhooks.

Integrations

Works well with Kubernetes (service discovery).

Can scrape application custom metrics (via client libraries in Go, Java, Python, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Grafana Usage

Grafana is a visualization and analytics platform. It is often paired with Prometheus for dashboards.

Key Uses:

Visualization

Connects to Prometheus and other data sources (Elasticsearch, Loki, InfluxDB, etc.).

Create dashboards with charts, graphs, heatmaps, single-stat panels.

Dashboards

Prebuilt dashboards for Kubernetes, Docker, MySQL, Kafka, Redis, etc.

Custom dashboards for your applications.

Alerting

Alerts can be configured directly in Grafana (or integrated from Prometheus).

Supports notification channels like Slack, Teams, Email, Webhooks.

Advanced Features

Annotations â†’ Mark deployments or incidents on graphs.

Templating â†’ Dynamic dashboards (choose namespace, pod, service).

Variables â†’ Filter dashboards per environment (staging, prod).

ðŸ”¹ Prometheus + Grafana Together

Prometheus â†’ Collects, stores, and queries metrics.

Grafana â†’ Visualizes those metrics in beautiful dashboards.
