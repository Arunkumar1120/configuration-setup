Sentry is an open-source error tracking and performance monitoring tool.
It helps developers detect, diagnose, and fix issues in applications (backend, frontend, mobile, desktop, etc.).

Think of it as real-time bug tracking + performance tracing for your apps.

üîπ Sentry Usage
1. Error Monitoring

Captures exceptions, crashes, stack traces from applications.
Provides context like:
Function names
Line numbers
User session info
Environment (staging, production)

2. Performance Monitoring

Tracks transaction traces across microservices.
Shows slow queries, bottlenecks, or endpoints with high latency.
Provides APM-like features (similar to Datadog, New Relic).

3. Release Tracking

Connects errors to specific deployments/releases.
Shows if new issues came after a code release.
Helps with regression tracking.

4. Alerts & Integrations

Alerts when error thresholds are exceeded (e.g., 50 errors/min).

Integrates with:
Slack, Microsoft Teams, Email, PagerDuty, Jira, GitHub, GitLab.

5. Session Replay (Frontend)

Records user sessions with errors.
Lets you ‚Äúwatch‚Äù how a user encountered an issue in the UI.
Useful for React, Angular, Vue, etc.
