ðŸ”¹ OpenTelemetry (OTel) Usage

OpenTelemetry is a CNCF project that provides a vendor-neutral standard for collecting metrics, logs, and traces.

Key Uses:

Instrumentation

Language SDKs (Java, Python, Go, Node.js, .NET, etc.) to add tracing and metrics to your app.

Auto-instrumentation for frameworks (Spring Boot, Flask, Express.js, gRPC, etc.).

Telemetry Data Types

Traces â†’ Distributed tracing (e.g., how a request flows across microservices).

Metrics â†’ Performance data (latency, throughput, memory, CPU).

Logs â†’ Structured/unstructured logs linked with traces.

OTel Collector

Receives telemetry from applications.

Can process, filter, batch, and export to backends like:

SigNoz
Prometheus
Jaeger
Tempo
Elasticsearch

Cloud services (AWS X-Ray, GCP Cloud Trace, Azure Monitor).

ðŸ”¹ SigNoz Usage

SigNoz is an open-source APM (Application Performance Monitoring) & observability platform, built to be a self-hosted alternative to Datadog / New Relic.

Key Uses:

Distributed Tracing (via OTel)

Visualize request flows across microservices.

Spot bottlenecks and high-latency services.

Metrics Monitoring

Out-of-the-box dashboards for system and application metrics.

Custom metrics from OTel SDKs or Prometheus exporters.

Log Management

Collect, search, and correlate logs.

Link logs directly with traces for root-cause analysis.

Dashboards & Alerts

Similar to Grafana, but integrated with tracing and logs.

Alerts via Slack, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, etc.

Kubernetes & Docker Monitoring

Auto-collects cluster metrics, pod health, and service traces.
