🔹 1. Apache Kafka

What it is: A distributed event streaming platform.
Usage:

Publish & subscribe to event streams.

Store streams reliably and at scale.

Process streams in real-time.


🔹 2. Schema Registry

What it is: A centralized schema management service (usually with Confluent).
Usage:

Ensures producers & consumers agree on data format (Avro/JSON/Protobuf).

Supports schema evolution (backward/forward compatibility).

Prevents “bad data” from breaking consumers.


🔹 3. ksqlDB

What it is: A streaming SQL engine for Kafka.
Usage:

Process Kafka topics with SQL-like queries (no Java code needed).

Create materialized views and new Kafka topics.

Real-time joins, aggregations, filters.

🔹 How They Work Together

Kafka: Stores event streams.

Schema Registry: Ensures all events have a defined schema.

ksqlDB: Lets you query & transform those streams in real time.

Kafka UI: Lets you monitor and manage the cluster easily.
