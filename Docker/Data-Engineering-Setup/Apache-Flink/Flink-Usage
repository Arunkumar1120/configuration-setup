Apache Flink Version : 1.20.1

Apache Flink is an open-source, distributed stream processing framework.
Itâ€™s built to handle unbounded (real-time/continuous) and bounded (batch) data at scale, with strong guarantees (state, consistency, fault tolerance).

Think of it as:

Like Spark, but designed natively for real-time streaming (not just micro-batches).

Like Kafka Streams, but more powerful (stateful processing, windows, exactly-once semantics, scalability).

ðŸ”¹ Core Features

Stream-first â†’ Batch is treated as a special case of streaming.

Low latency + high throughput â†’ Processes millions of events per second.

Stateful processing â†’ Keeps track of state across events.

Event-time support â†’ Handles late/early events with watermarks.

Fault tolerance â†’ Uses checkpoints & savepoints with exactly-once guarantees.

Runs anywhere â†’ Standalone, YARN, Kubernetes, cloud, or embedded.

Summary
Flink = Real-time + Stateful + Scalable data processing framework.
Itâ€™s used for analytics, ETL, event-driven apps, and ML pipelines where real-time matters.
