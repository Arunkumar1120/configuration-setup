Apache Flink is an open-source, distributed stream processing framework.
Itâ€™s built to handle unbounded (real-time/continuous) and bounded (batch) data at scale, with strong guarantees (state, consistency, fault tolerance).

Think of it as:

Like Spark, but designed natively for real-time streaming (not just micro-batches).

Like Kafka Streams, but more powerful (stateful processing, windows, exactly-once semantics, scalability).

ðŸ”¹ Core Features

Stream-first â†’ Batch is treated as a special case of streaming.

Low latency + high throughput â†’ Processes millions of events per second.

Stateful processing â†’ Keeps track of state across events.

Event-time support â†’ Handles late/early events with watermarks.

Fault tolerance â†’ Uses checkpoints & savepoints with exactly-once guarantees.

Runs anywhere â†’ Standalone, YARN, Kubernetes, cloud, or embedded.

ðŸ”¹ Flink Usage (Where Itâ€™s Used)
 1. Real-time Analytics

Processing logs, IoT sensor data, clickstreams, financial transactions.

Example: Fraud detection on credit card transactions in milliseconds.

 2. ETL Pipelines

Ingest from Kafka, transform, enrich, and push to a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, S3, Elasticsearch).

Example: Log preprocessing from Kafka â†’ Flink â†’ Elasticsearch â†’ Kibana.

 3. Event-driven Applications

Complex event processing (CEP).

Example: Detecting patterns (like login failures â†’ suspicious activity).

 4. Machine Learning & AI

Real-time feature extraction for ML models.

Example: Predicting churn or recommendations while the user is still online.

 5. Batch + Streaming Unification

You can run the same code for batch and streaming (no need for separate tools).

Example: Nightly batch jobs & continuous data pipelines with same API.

ðŸ”¹ Example Use Cases in Companies

Netflix â†’ Real-time monitoring of streaming metrics.

Uber â†’ Dynamic pricing, ETA prediction, fraud detection.

Alibaba â†’ Processes trillions of events per day for e-commerce analytics.

Financial services â†’ Risk scoring, fraud detection, compliance checks.

ðŸ”¹ APIs in Flink

DataStream API â†’ Low-level, powerful, event-by-event processing.

Table / SQL API â†’ Declarative queries, easier for analysts.

CEP (Complex Event Processing) â†’ Pattern detection.

Gelly â†’ Graph processing.

Summary
Flink = Real-time + Stateful + Scalable data processing framework.
Itâ€™s used for analytics, ETL, event-driven apps, and ML pipelines where real-time matters.
