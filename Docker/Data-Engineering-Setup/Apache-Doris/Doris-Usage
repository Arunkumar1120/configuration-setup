Apache Doris is an open-source, high-performance real-time analytical database (OLAP).
Itâ€™s designed for fast queries on large-scale data, especially for analytics dashboards, reporting, and ad-hoc queries.

Think of it as:

Similar to ClickHouse or BigQuery â†’ but simpler to use.

Handles real-time + batch data ingestion.

Supports standard SQL for BI tools.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

Real-time + Batch Ingestion

From Kafka, Flink, Spark, MySQL, Hive, Iceberg, etc.

Real-time analytics on streaming + historical data.

Fast OLAP Queries

Millisecond-level response on billions of rows.

Columnar storage + vectorized execution + MPP architecture.

Standard SQL + MySQL Protocol

You can query Doris like MySQL (mysql -h doris_host -P9030).

Compatible with BI tools: Superset, Tableau, PowerBI, Grafana.

Distributed & Scalable

Shared-nothing architecture.

Easy horizontal scaling (just add more nodes).

Storage Engine

Columnar + compression.

Supports indexes (inverted, bitmap, Bloom filter) for acceleration.

ðŸ”¹ Architecture (Simple View)

FE (Frontend) â†’ Query planning, metadata, client connection.

BE (Backend) â†’ Actual storage & execution.

Broker â†’ Optional, for reading external files (HDFS, S3, etc.).

You need at least 1 FE + 1 BE to run Doris.

ðŸ”¹ Usage Scenarios
 1. Real-time Analytics

Ingest data from Kafka/Flink â†’ Query instantly.

Example: Track orders, website traffic, IoT sensor stats in real time.

 2. BI Dashboards

Connect BI tools to Doris via SQL/MySQL protocol.

Example: Sales dashboard showing live KPIs on billions of rows.

 3. Data Warehouse / Lakehouse Query

Query historical + real-time data from Hive, Iceberg, S3, etc.

Example: Run OLAP queries on clickstream + transactional data.

 4. Log / Monitoring Analysis

Store logs (structured/semi-structured) â†’ query fast.

Example: User activity logs â†’ alert on anomalies.

In short:
Apache Doris = Real-time OLAP DB â†’ great for analytics dashboards, real-time + batch data, BI integration, and ad-hoc SQL queries on large data.
