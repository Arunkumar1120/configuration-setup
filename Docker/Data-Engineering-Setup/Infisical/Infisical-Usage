Infisical is an open-source secret management platform.
It helps you manage and inject sensitive data (API keys, database passwords, tokens, certificates, etc.) across environments in a secure and centralized way. Think of it as an alternative to Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or 1Password for DevOps.
