OpenMetadata is an open-source metadata management & data governance platform.
It’s like a central hub for discovering, cataloging, governing, and collaborating on all your data assets (databases, tables, pipelines, dashboards, ML models, etc.).

🔹 Key Features & Usage
 1. Data Catalog / Discovery

Connects to databases, data warehouses, lakes, BI tools, ML systems.

Automatically extracts metadata (schemas, lineage, profiling, usage).

Lets you search across all datasets & dashboards.

Example: Search for "customer_id" → see where it exists (Postgres table, Snowflake table, dbt model, Looker dashboard).

 2. Data Lineage

Tracks end-to-end flow of data across systems.

Helps debug “where did this column come from?” or “why is my dashboard wrong?”.

Example: Kafka → Flink → Snowflake → dbt → Looker → Business dashboard.

 3. Data Quality & Profiling

Run data quality tests (null check, uniqueness, referential integrity).

Profile datasets → distribution, min/max, null %, row count.

Alerts on anomalies.

Example: Ensure email column in users table is never null.

 4. Governance & Policies

Define ownership (who owns this dataset?).

Tag sensitive data (PII, GDPR, HIPAA).

Set access policies for roles.

Example: Mark SSN column as PII → restrict usage → alert if exposed in reports.

 5. Collaboration

Business glossary (define terms like “Active User”).

Comments, reviews, discussions directly on datasets.

Data ownership assignment.

Example: Finance analyst asks a question directly on the "revenue" dashboard metadata page.

 6. Integration

Supports data sources: Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, MySQL, Redshift, Kafka, Flink, dbt, Airflow, Looker, PowerBI, Tableau, Superset, MLflow, etc.

APIs + OpenMetadata UI.

🔹 Usage in Companies

Data Engineers → manage pipelines & lineage.

Data Analysts → discover trusted datasets.

Data Scientists → explore ML-ready features.

Governance Teams → enforce compliance & track sensitive data.

🔹 Example Flow with OpenMetadata

Ingest metadata → Connect to Postgres, Kafka, dbt, Looker.

Catalog → Tables, topics, dashboards are auto-discovered.

Add ownership & glossary → Assign dataset owners, define "Customer".

Track lineage → See how raw → curated → reports.

Quality tests → Ensure "order_id" is unique.

Collaborate → Analysts ask questions, engineers respond within OpenMetadata.

🔹 Why Use OpenMetadata?

Single source of truth for metadata.

Boost trust in data (no more “which dataset is correct?”).

Improve productivity (search instead of asking Slack/Email).

Enable governance & compliance (PII tracking, auditability).

⚡ In short:
OpenMetadata = central data catalog + lineage + quality + governance + collaboration platform.
