Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a backend-as-a-service (BaaS).
It gives you a ready-to-use backend on top of PostgreSQL with APIs, authentication, file storage, and real-time capabilities â€” so you can build apps quickly without managing all the backend code yourself.
