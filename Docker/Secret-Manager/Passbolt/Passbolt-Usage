Version : v4.9.0

Passbolt is an open-source, self-hosted password manager designed for teams and organizations.
Unlike personal managers like Bitwarden or LastPass, Passbolt is built for collaboration (sharing credentials across teams securely).

It focuses on security-first design:

All secrets are end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) with OpenPGP.

Each user has their own GPG keypair.

Server canâ€™t read the passwords â€” only the client decrypts them.
